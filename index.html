            <li><b>Data Security</b></li>
                <p>Data security is one of the most significant factors that keep business owners up at night. Cloud computing can help alleviate this stress. 
                    In the past, there have always been arguments that cloud-based platforms are at risk of being hacked. However, the cloud’s heavy encryption reduces the risk of data theft. </p>
            <li><b>Cost Reduction</b></li>
                <p>Switching to any new technology can incur some costs. It is no different for the cloud too. But if done right, businesses will be able to reap the ROIs within 6-12 months. Consider it an investment that can pay off in the long run. The ROI can be in the form of product longevity & scalability, to name a few, and eliminates the need for extra software and server maintenance costs. Plus, the pay-as-you-go model means you only pay for what you need. It’s no wonder CIOs are loving it and implementing it everywhere. </p>
            <li><b>Complete control</b></li>
                <p>Data loss, lags, and operational dysfunction often lead to immense scrutiny for organizations. The cloud provides sufficient control over the company’s ongoing activities. Using the Cloud, users can track the accessibility, usability, and deployability of sensitive data from a bird’s eye view. Compartmentalizing tasks streamlines the work and allows employees to access their duties effectively. A direct path to task execution is enabled, and the work can be understood clearly.</p>
            <li><b>Flexibility</b></li>
                <p>Focusing on more than just your in-house IT structure can be limiting and lead to poor execution. Instead, you need to optimize your space to cater to your customers’ needs and be unrestricted by low bandwidth. That’s where the Cloud comes in. It’s flexible and can handle last-minute changes without compromising on quality. As a result, you can make quick business decisions without worrying about IT infrastructure impacts.</p>
            <li><b>Mobility</b></li>

With automatic software updates and cyclic upgrades, users can now focus their time & energy on the core business operations.  
                    IT departments are no longer required to perform manual updates in a business. As a result, money and time that would have been spent on outside IT consultation are saved. </p>
            <li><b>Disaster Recovery</b></li>
                <p>The biggest disaster a company can undergo is “loss of data.” Did you know that a ransomware attack could typically cost you $4.54 million? However, the cloud is a repository for backed-up data, which helps companies recover their lost data with ease and security. Around 85% of technical executives found security to be a significant challenge, says Statista. </p>
            <li><b>Easy Management</b></li>
                <p>Since the organizational data is stored in the cloud, it is easy to assess the work, utilities, and tasks. Such a clear task path makes it easy to manage the services. 
                    According to Gartner, businesses will deploy 95% of all new workloads on cloud-native platforms by 2025. Compared to previous techniques, cloud service management is fairly simple because data is organized and stored in the cloud with easy access. </p>
            <li><b>Loss Prevention</b></li>
                <p>A crisis cannot be foretold, and one of the worst ones that can befall an organization is the loss of assets. If an organization is not leveraging the cloud, it is subjecting its data to undue risk. The cloud allows the data to be automatically backed up in encrypted silos, avoiding data loss. 
                    Even if your computer crashes or is infected with malware, your information stays safe and sound in the cloud. It also provides quick access via an internet connection, even if the local computer is not operational.      
                    Data loss prevention feature detects and prevents data breaches by encrypting sensitive data while in use, in transit, or at rest.  </p>
